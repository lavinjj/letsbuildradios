I wanted to start off with one of the simplest radios you can build that can actually be used to make contacts as an 
Amateur operator, the Michigan Mighty Mite. This little transmitter puts out around 1/2 watt of power and can be built 
for use on all of the major bands allowing anyone with an Amateur license to use to make a contact.
