This site was inspired by the guys from the [Solder Smoke podcast](http://www.soldersmoke.com), Bill Meara, (M0HBR), and Pete Juliano, 
(N6QW), who do a great job discussing the trials and tribulations of getting started in building your own radios from 
scratch.

There are so many great web sites and media available on the Internet that one can quickly get confused trying to get 
started in the home brewing side of Amateur Radio. I hope that as I chronicle my adventures in learning about and 
building radios, I provide some valuable insight to others who are also getting started in one of the aspects of Amateur 
Radio that has always had me excited about the hobby.

With the introductions out of the way let's get started building some radios!
